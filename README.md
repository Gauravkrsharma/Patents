# Patents Portable Mobile Cum Magnetic Card Reader Or Smart Phone Cum POS System
1.PORTABLE MOBILE CUM MAGNETIC CARD READER OR SMART

PHONE CUM POS SYSTEM
Description: -
(1) Field of Invention: Implementation of magnetic card reader in SMART PHONE.

(2) Our Aim: To Simulate & synthesize& design of magnetic card reader(Credit/Debit
Card reader) in smart phone and used it as POS machine as per requirement.
(3) Use of Invention: smart phone cum POS machine so that smart phone can also be
used as credit/debit card reader for any of the transaction either it is from credit card,
debit card or any of the banking service provider.
(4) Problem association:
Now these days separate POS system (A POS or point of sale purchase is the “point”
where a transaction is finalized or the moment where a customer tenders payment in
exchange for goods and services. Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit
cards, credit cards, mobile payments) used for digital payment. Many different vendors
(Here vendors are describe as the service providers for digital payment like ICICI,HDFC
& Vodafone M-paisa ) have different POS systems on which they also applied different
TAX schemes for other payments. Another limitation of theses POS machine that most
of them use Landline to be operated.to overcome these problems we proposed a portable
POS system associated with smart phones
(5) Objective of invention: over 2billion people of this world are using smart phone.
India, the second most populous country in the world, is projected to pass the United
States in number of smartphone users in 2017. Around 220 million people in the U.S.
will use a smartphone by 2017, compared to nearly 300 million in India. Over 60% of
world population are using smart phone for digital transaction or cashless
transcation.Our objective is to make easier these transaction as compared with present
POS system because after having portable mobile cum POS any one can make payment
from anywhere by his/her mobile device.
(6) Detailed Description of invention: To developed a portable magnetic card reader
cum smart phone or POS cum mobile phone.
(7) Claim: Implement a magnetic card reader with in smart phone to be used as POS
machine.We also donot use any external power source for our system we use mobile
battery as power source.
2.PEER TO PEER CHARGING OF UBIQUITOUS DEVICES
Description: -
(1) Field of Invention: Implementation of devices to devices charging of ubiquitous
devices
(2) Our Aim: To Simulate & synthesize& design of charging of ubiquitous devices
Using inductive coupling method where a ubiquitous device is transmits & receives
power at same time.

(3) Use of Invention: Charging in absence of any external power source (AC supply).

(4) Problem association:

Ubiquitous devices have privileged the users to roam around across the world even to
extreme remote locations. The access to Internet through Wifi or data services have
helped to increase the number of users tremendously, but issue which has been
bothering the users is life of battery so that devices can be accessed 24X7. All the
charging devices/sources need AC power supply as input.
Only option available is power banks, which need extra baggage or weight in the pocket.
There is no solution available which reduces the pocket space or weight in the baggage.
A solution is needed in which neighbourhood or peer devices can be used as a power
source/bank so that no extra baggage is required.

(5) Objective of invention: over 2billion people of this world are using smart phone.
India, the second most populous country in the world, is projected to pass the United
States in number of smartphone users in 2017. Around 220 million people in the U.S.
will use a smartphone by 2017, compared to nearly 300 million in India. Over 60% of
world population are using smart phone for digital transaction or cashless transcation.
The output power associated with these smart phone is very less(or a short period of
time approximate 10hrs when fully used).
(8) Detailed Description of invention: To developed A MOBILE PHONE CHARGER
Here we propose a model for wireless charging by using peer device battery as power
source (transmitter and when required it behave like a receiver)
(9) Claim: Implement inductive coil topology inside mobile phone to charge another
mobile. We also donot use any external power source for our system we use mobile
battery as power source
